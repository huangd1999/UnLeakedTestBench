For the given code snippet and a list of conditions need to be satisfied, generate a test case that will satisfiy these conditions. Here is an example:
[Example]
Code:
```Python
class Solution: #1
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:    #2
        numMap = {{}} #3
        n = len(nums)   #4
    #5
        for i in range(n):  #6
            numMap[nums[i]] = i #7
    #8
        for i in range(n):  #9
            complement = target - nums[i]   #10
            if complement in numMap and numMap[complement] != i:    #11
                return [i, numMap[complement]]  #12
    #13
        return []   #14
```
Conditions:
Step 1: If line 12 `return [i, numMap[complement]]` is executed, then the `if` condition `(complement in numMap and numMap[complement] != i)` in line 11 shoud be true.
Step 2: If condition `complement in numMap` is true, at least one `target - nums[i]` in line 10 equals an element in nums, which means there exists two elements in `nums` that their sum is equal to `target`.
Step 3: If condition `numMap[complement] != i` is ture, then `numMap[target - nums[i]] != i`, meaning that the index of `target - nums[i]` is not equal to `i`.
Step 4: Generally, to execute line 12, we need to ensure that there exists two different elements in `nums` that their sum is equal to `target`.

Generated test case:
```Python
def test_twoSum():
    solution = Solution()
    assert solution.twoSum([2,7,11,15], 9) == [0, 1]
```
[\Example]

In a similar fashion, generate a test case for the following code snippet and conditions. Your test function should be named `test_{func_name}`.
Code:
```Python
{program}
```
Conditions:
{conditions}

You should only generate the test case, without any additional explanation.
